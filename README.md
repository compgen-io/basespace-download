# basespace-download
Command line downloader for files from Illumina's Basespace

This project will download files for a *Sample* or *Project* from
Basespace. You must possess a valid app-token from Basespace in order to
use this application.

This is my first Go application, so the code may be a little ugly, but it works!

## Installation
You need to have [Go](http://golang.org) installed first. Next, you can retrieve the Go code and build it in one step:

    go get github.com/compgen-io/basespace-download

Next, you can copy the binary from $GOPATH/bin to anywhere in your $PATH.
